# We want to byte-compile the .py files within the packages using the new

# 
# Unfortunately, rpmbuild's infrastructure requires us to jump through some
# hoops to avoid byte-compiling with the system python 2 version:
#   /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros sets up build policy that (amongst other things)
# defines __os_install_post.  In particular, "brp-python-bytecompile" is
# invoked without an argument thus using the wrong version of python
# (/usr/bin/python, rather than the freshly built python), thus leading to
# numerous syntax errors, and incorrect magic numbers in the .pyc files.  We
# thus override __os_install_post to avoid invoking this script:
%global __os_install_post /usr/lib/rpm/brp-compress \
  %{!?__debug_package:/usr/lib/rpm/brp-strip %{__strip}} \

  /usr/lib/rpm/brp-strip-comment-note %{__strip} %{__objdump} \
  /usr/lib/rpm/brp-python-hardlink 
# to remove the invocation of brp-python-bytecompile, whilst keeping the
# invocation of brp-python-hardlink (since this should still work for python3
# pyc/pyo files)


# We need to get a newer configure generated out of configure.in for the following

#   patch 55 (systemtap)

#
# For patch 55 (systemtap), we need to get a new header for configure to use
#
# configure.in requires autoconf-2.65, but the version in Fedora is currently
# autoconf-2.66
#
# For now, we'll generate a patch to the generated configure script and

# full build
# (ii) regenerate_autotooling_patch 1 : intended to be run on a developer's
# workstation: prep the source tree without patching configure, then rerun a
# local copy of autoconf-2.65, regenerate the patch, then exit, without doing
# the rest of the build

# (sent upstream for python 3 as http://bugs.python.org/issue9216 ; see RHEL6

# - enforce usage of the _hashlib implementation: don't fall back to the _md5

# - don't build the _md5 and _sha* modules; rely on the _hashlib implementation

# they assumed would become sha3. This patch was adapted to give it the

# sha3 implementation at that time).In 3.4.0.b2, sha3 implementation was reverted
# (see http://bugs.python.org/issue16113), but the alterations were left in the

# Downstream only patch that should be removed when we compile all guaranteed

#   exception that is being caught and exception is logged:
#   http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2de806c8b070/Lib/hashlib.py#l217
# - logging the exception makes logging module run basicConfig
# - when lib2to3 tests are run again, lib2to3 runs basicConfig again, which
#   doesn't do anything, because it was run previously
#   (logging.root.handlers != []), which means that the default setup
#   (most importantly logging level) is not overriden. That means that a test
#   relying on this will fail (test_filename_changing_on_output_single_dir)

# (New patches go here ^^^)
#
# When adding new patches to "python" and "python3" in Fedora 17 onwards,
# please try to keep the patch numbers in-sync between the two specfiles:
#
#   - use the same patch number across both specfiles for conceptually-equivalent
#     fixes, ideally with the same name
#
#   - when a patch is relevant to both specfiles, use the same introductory
#     comment in both specfiles where possible (to improve "diff" output when
#     comparing them)
#
#   - when a patch is only relevant for one of the two specfiles, leave a gap
#     in the patch numbering in the other specfile, adding a comment when
#     omitting a patch, both in the manifest section here, and in the "prep"
#     phase below
#
# Hopefully this will make it easier to ensure that all relevant fixes are

your applications with Python %{pybasever}, see other distributions
that support it, such as CentOS or RHEL with Software Collections.
